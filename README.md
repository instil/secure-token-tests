# secure-token-tests
This repository contains automated tests to validate secure token handling practices in web applications using Playwright. The tests ensure access tokens are not stored in local storage or session storage, validate secure cookie attributes, implement the Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern, and test OAuth security enhancements using DPoP.
